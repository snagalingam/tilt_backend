    "description": "The James and Patricia Sood Scholarship was founded in honor of a special couple, both teachers. It is awarded to a young adult student who is pursuing a degree and career in education. After serving as an engineer in the US Navy and then having a successful career in business, James went back to school to follow his passion–teaching. He spent many happy years as a Professor of International Business at American University, where he retired as Professor Emeritus in the 1990s. Both James and Patricia had cancer, but that fact did not define them in the least. They were positive people who always lived life to the fullest, and they were grateful for all of their blessings. They were married for over 50 years. As their daughter, I am proud to offer this scholarship in their honor. Applicants must have been between the ages of 15 and 39 during their own diagnosis/treatment or during the diagnosis/treatment of their parent or sibling.

Enter the Don't mess with Texas Scholarship Contest for a chance to win a $6,000 grand prize scholarship or one of two $2,000 scholarship awards! Sponsored by Forestar and in partnership with Keep Texas Beautiful, the Don't mess with Texas Scholarship recognizes the achievements of high school seniors who have taken a leadership role to prevent litter in their schools and communities and build awareness of the Don't mess with Texas initiative. Scholarships are awarded based on student essays submitted with applications. Since 1986, Don't mess with Texas has reminded people to keep litter off Texas roads. Litter is defined as trash that is left on the ground in a public place or on a roadway, rather than in a trash receptacle. The most commonly littered items are wrappers, packaging, cans, and cigarette butts. These trash items create an unsightly mess that is costly to clean up.In 300-350 words, describe how your actions support the Don't mess with Texas litter prevention and beautification message. How did you identify a specific litter-related problem in your school or community? What creative and/or sustainable solution did you develop to address the problem of trash? What motivated you? How did you motivate others not to litter? Please include any statistics or results that show the impact of your effort.You may submit a handwritten or typed essay along with the application. You may also provide up to three (3) additional documents or photos that support your essay. Winners may be asked to participate in a brief video interview describing their litter prevention project.

The benefit is doled out on an annual basis, beginning as soon as a Soldier completes his first year of qualifying service, and provided at a rate of either 33.33% of his or her loan’s outstanding principle balance, or $1,500, whichever amount is greater. Eligibility Criteria:To qualify for Army student loan repayment benefits, you must enlist for Active Duty service in the Army and: -Request to participate in the LRP program during your enlistment process.-Get your participation annotated in writing on your enlistment contract. -Decline participation in the Post 9/11 GI Bill in writing, using DD Form 2366 (see section below for details). -Hold a high school diploma (GED equivalents will not suffice) at the time of your enlistment. -Score a 50 or higher on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (your main score from the ASVAB you took before enlisting). -Enlist in a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) deemed eligible for participation in the CLRP at the time of your enlistment (check with your recruiter to make sure that your MOS applies at the time you join up, as eligible programs change by the day). -Be on a non-prior service accession (unless you’re using enlistment in the Reserves to qualify for LRP benefits). -Have a student loan that qualifies for participating in the Army’s CLRP program (one insured or guaranteed by the Higher Education Act of 1965, Title IV, Part B, D, or E).

On August 26, 1920, this legislation was ratified by the states and became the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. To honor this significant moment in history, the Network of enlightened Women (NeW) Essay Contest is giving women the opportunity to reflect on and write about the importance of this movement and how it has impacted women in America. The NeW Essay Contest will be open to female high school seniors and college students. One high school student and one college student will each win a $500 scholarship and potentially have the essay published by our essay co-sponsor, the Washington Examiner.

Production value is not a factor, but it must be three minutes or fewer in length. The video can be about any STEM topic, not necessarily your field of study. Pick a topic that excites and fascinates you. We don't need to hear about the latest thing in science news (unless that's your jam).Be scientifically accurate. We encourage you to cite the sources used to research your topic. Ideally, this would be in a slide or frame at the end of your video. Upload your video to YouTube and mark it ‘public.’To be eligible, you identify as a woman in a way that is significant to you and you will be attending college full-time in the United States during the academic year following the award, seeking an undergraduate degree in STEM. All fields within science, technology, engineering, and math are eligible. A STEM field must be your major field of study (not your minor).Please note: Part of being a science communicator is leading by example. If applicable, please film your video in a way that complies with your local safety regulations related to COVID-19. An advisory board of women who hold higher degrees and work in a broad range of STEM fields will review applications and select finalists. Finalists will be notified late winter/early spring and will move onto the next round to submit additional materials. A winner will be announced in April.
